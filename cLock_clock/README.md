# cLock_clock
This folder contains everything that's related to the actual clock client, run on the clock device.
time.js and interface.css can be modified to set up very custom time rules or stylesheets.
Otherwise, everything in this directory can be left alone, as it'll be acted upon by the server or client
to make modifications to settings.

### DO NOT MODIFY
Don't modify the file named score.js, as it contains a jquery-equse library that's used by the clock client.
I mean, you can feel free to change it, but don't blame me when something breaks.
